# Lee-Sochay-Portfolio

## Description

This challenge started from scratch with the development of a professional portfolio utilizing HTML and CSS. The focus for this week was to utilize advanced CSS, specifically flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables to create an interactive and responsive portfolio webpage. The general layout includes sections for the header, introduction/salutation, about me (education, experience, professional organizations, publications, and skills), projects, and contact information. To make these sections, flexbox was used to provide the containers for positioning and styling. Media Queries were used to provide responsiveness based on the screen width. And finally, CSS variable(s) were used to provide a color style that can be used in areas within the CSS file.
This is a beginning effort to build a professional portfolio to satisfy the acceptance criteria based on the User Story.
User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
Acceptance Criteria
Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Usage

By creating the HTML and CSS as described, the portfolio demonstrates instances of satisfying the user story and acceptance criteria. As a working document, it does leave room for updates and improvements as knowledge and skills are expanded.
